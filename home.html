	<h1>Who are we?</h1>
	<p>Formed from ashes of a previous modding group, we're a collective of amateur hobbyists developing games and mods for games in our spare time.</p>
	<p>Between our various teams, we are currently developing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deathmatch Classic: Refragged - A remake/continuation of Deathmatch Classic in the Source Engine, adding new maps, weapons, game modes, QOL improvements and more!</li>
		<li>Lambda Fortress - Play Half-Life 2 and other Source campaigns as the Team Fortress 2 mercenaries, both singleplayer and co-op!</li>
		<li>The Espionage Project - A stealthy TF-themed multiplayer mod. Cause coorporate espionage, or stop it!</li>
		<li>Quadgoyle - The multi-platform Source Engine multi-tool!</li>
		<li>TBA VN Project - A Visual Novel by Rahim Ali and MTD. More info to be announced in the future.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Partners:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adastral - A unified installing solution for sourcemods, built for reliability, efficiency, speed and ease of use.</li>
		<li>Fortress Connected - A bombastic conglomeration of a bunch of Team Fortress based modes, mods, and whatever the hell else we want to add to it, built off of Lambda Fortress.</li>
	</ul>
