		<h1>BLOG PROGRESS</h1>
		<p>Alright so I've started to work on how the blog will be managed. Still plenty of work to be done but heres some test stuff.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I can summon a list of the dmcr blog posts with only the following html:</p>
		<p>&lt;div class=&quot;blogPostList&quot; id=&quot;dmcrList&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;</p>
		<p>Here is what that looks like:</p>
		<div class="blogPostList" id="dmcrList"></div>
		<br>
		<p>The info is retreived from a json file that contains the information for all of the blog posts. It only works for dmcr right now but thats also all I have at the moment.</p>
