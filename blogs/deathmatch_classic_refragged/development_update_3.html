<div id="articlecontent" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone, MTD here again, It's time for a new media roundup for Deathmatch Classic: Refragged!</p>
<p><br>If you are interested in helping out with DMC:R, feel free to drop by our <a href="https://discord.gg/dSfXTNEGP7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server</a> and DM me @mtd_bk.</p>
<p>Alright, let's get into the content!</p>
<h3><u><strong>Soundtrack:</strong></u></h3>
<p>We've teased this track on the Discord before, but we like to post the full songs here. So, here's the full version of the track <strong>Beneath</strong>, composed by the talented <strong>LAMAJKER</strong>.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Maps:</strong></u></h3>
<p><u><strong>DM5 - The Cistern</strong></u><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dm5a.png" alt="dm5a" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dm5b.png" alt="dm5b" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dm5c.png" alt="dm5c" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dm5d.png" alt="dm5d" class="fullImage"></p>
<p>Remade by yours truly, DM5 never made an appearance in DMC but did show up in its cancelled ThreeWave addon. This version holds an enhanced environmental look to that.</p>
<p><u><strong>P:SE3 - Venom<img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/pse3a.png" alt="pse3a" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/pse3b.png" alt="pse3b" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/pse3c.png" alt="pse3c" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/pse3d.png" alt="pse3d" class="fullImage"></strong></u></p>
<p>Remade by ryker, this map was in the original DMC, it was remake of a singleplayer level from Dario Casali's Prodigy: Special Edition. Being a singleplayer level, it's quite large and is best played with 8+ players.</p>
<p><u><strong> DCDM3 <img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dcdm3a.png" alt="dcdm3a" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dcdm3b.png" alt="dcdm3b" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dcdm3c.png" alt="dcdm3c" class="fullImage"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/dcdm3d.png" alt="dcdm3d" class="fullImage"></strong></u></p>
<p>Remade by PJX, this is another map originally by Dario Casali. Some of you may recognize this layout as Snark Pit from Half-Life, well it originated from this map here.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Customization:</strong></u></h3>
<p><u><strong>Triple Player Coloring:<br><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/coloring.png" alt="coloring" class="fullImage"></strong></u></p>
<p>Yes it's true! Not only can you color two parts of your playermodel like you could in Quake and Half-Life, but you can even color a third spot! Your Primary and Tertiary colors are switched to team colors for team modes. <br><br><strong><u>New Barney &amp; HECU Grunt Playermodels:</u></strong></p>
<div class="center" style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/beren-franklin-barney.jpg" alt="" class="halfImage"></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/beren-franklin-hgrunt2.jpg" alt="beren franklin hgrunt2" class="halfImage"></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<p>You'll be able to play as Barney in his Black Mesa Security Guard Outfit, as well as a Gasmask or Beret wearing HECU Marine. These were created by the talented beren franklin!</p>
<p><u><strong>Speedometer:</strong></u></p>
<div class="center" style="text-align: center;">
<p><u><strong><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/speedometer.gif" alt="speedometer" style="box-sizing:borderbox;width:15%"></strong></u></p>
</div>
<p><u><strong><br></strong></u>You can optionally track your speed with the speedometer. You can set it to either be on the bottom of your HUD or by the crosshair.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Misc Stuff:</strong></u></h3>
<p><u><strong>Armor Resistance Percentage:<br></strong></u></p>
<div class="center" style="text-align: center;">
<p><u><strong><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4389/4388842/profile/ArmorPercentage.png" alt="" class="thirdImage"></strong></u></p>
</div>
<p><br>There is now a resistance percentage above your armor points, showing how much damage you'll resist, this changes depending on what armor type you have. Custom values work too if you want to make Custom armors on your maps.</p>
<p><strong><u>Achievements:<br></u></strong>Flare145 has been working on artwork for the Steam Achievements. Here are some of my favorites and their requirements. <a href="https://flare145.com/projects/deathmatch_classic_refragged" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can check out the process of how these were made on his website.</a> The achievements wont take a <em>super</em> long time to achieve but they also shouldn't be a cakewalk. However they are all still subject to change.</p>
