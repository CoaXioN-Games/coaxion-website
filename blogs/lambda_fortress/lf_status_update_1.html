	<p>Greetings from the Lambda Fortress team @ CoaXioN! We're here today to discuss the future of Lambda Fortress. With the TF2 SDK update released, the trajectory for this mod has been majorly altered, so let's talk about it!</p>
	<h2><ins>Steam</ins></h2>
	<p>The biggest change is that we have the potential to release on Steam legally! This was never something we ever thought would ever happen. It'll open up the opportunity for so many more players to experience the mod faster and simpler. The catch is that, in a way, we have to redo a lot of stuff. But on the bright side, a whole lot more is done for us now.</p>

	<p>Being on Steam also means we can have workshop support. We plan to launch LF with support for it on release so you can add all the asset replacements and campaigns for anyone to play!</p>

	<h2><ins>Improved Codebase</ins></h2>

	<p>Once we bring our stuff to the new SDK, we'll be completely free from the bloat and bugs of LF:E.
	We'll be able to just focus on bringing over our improvements and finishing new ones.
	Previously, a majority of the work on the mod was focused on reimplementing modern TF2 features and fixing hundreds of bugs.</p>
	
	<p>Now we don't have to worry about those since it's built off of Live TF2. Many of the things that bloated LF:Extended like Halloween are still here but aren't buggy/intrusive,
	so they can still stick around now for you guys to use in custom stuff.</p>

	<h2><ins>TF2 Item Parity</ins></h2>
	<p>One of the biggest hurdles for us was reimplementing a lot of the TF2 weapons.
	This is no longer an issue as we have the code for every weapon now, ready for use.
	The SDK also allows us to read from your Steam inventories, so we can let you guys use your skins, hats, named items, etc.</p>
	<p>In regards to weapons specifically, we don't plan to allow for every weapon to be useable.
	Weapons with no practical use in LF such as the Homewrecker, Red Tape Recorder and Razorback for example will be disabled by default.
	Previously we would've rebalanced these weapons, but we'd rather preserve all existing weapon behavior from Live TF2 and just add new weapons instead.
	We don't want to confuse players' muscle memory with these weapons.</p>
	
	<p>We also know that some players might not want to see cosmetics and other flashy items, whether out of personal preference or just to increase FPS.
	We will be adding individual options to disable Cosmetics, Weapon skins, Unusuals, etc. We will also be adding an option to force stock weapons only as well</p>
	
	<h2><ins>What's Left to do?</ins></h2>
	<p>We need to redo all of our maps.
	Not only did they previously use leaked VMFs, but they were 20 years old, and Half-life 2 has received a ton of map fixes and improvements over time, especially after the anniversary update.
	We will try and copy over any of our fixes and additions we can, and finish the rest from scratch.</p>
	<p>We'll still try to ensure compatibility for various custom mod campaigns.
	Half-Life: Source support is still up in the air due to a decent chunk of its code not being public.
	It's something we'll look into more after release.</p>
	<p>Additionally, we will be overhauling various menus and adding QOL features as already planned, like animations for holding the gravity gun or holding nothing.</p>
	<p>Even with major setbacks like having to redo maps, we think we're actually way closer to release than ever before.</p>
	
	<h3>However...</h3>
	
	<h2><ins>Help Needed!</ins></h2>
	<p>We still need more help to get this thing done.
	We need additional help with programming and mapping.
	We have a lot of code to rebase and many improvements to add.
	We need mappers to help fix up any issues with the maps and make sure everything works as intended.</p>
	<p>If you are experienced in programming (and know how to rebase) or are experienced in mapping. Please contact us on Discord  @alexepisode, @mtd_bk, @stoneman!</p>
	
	<p><h3>Thank you all for your continued support, we hope to see you soon! The future of Lambda Fortress has never been brighter.</h3></p>
