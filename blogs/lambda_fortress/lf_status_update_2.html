	<p>It's been about a week since Lambda Fortress publicly dropped on Steam and the attention we've gotten from it has been unimaginable! With this mass attention, we thought we'd shine some light on what we're working on and what this project will and wont include.</p>
	<h2><ins>A Quick Detour About Help Needed</ins></h2>
	<p>We're still looking for more developers to assist us. We've gotten some since the last blog but we're looking for more, including new roles.</p>

	<p><b>We're still looking for <u>programmers and mappers</u>, but we're also now looking for a <u>graphic designer</u> to help create kill icons or achievement icons, or both!
	If you're interested in helping the team, DM @alexepsiode, @stoneman or @mtd_bk on Discord.</b></p>

	<h2><ins>What does Lambda Fortress include?</h2></ins>
	<p>Lambda Fortress is about playing through Half-Life 2 and other Source campaigns as the TF2 Mercs. When we say "Other source campaigns" we don't mean like Left 4 Dead and Portal, we mean other Half-Life 2 mods and map-packs. 
	We'll try and add more compatibilities for mods over time, but most stuff that requires custom code will not be playable immediately.</p>
	<p>Versus has always been in discussions when talking about LF, it's not something we want to have on release immediately (we'd rather get the main game in your hands first) but we'll definitely be working on it afterwards.</p>
	
	<p>We have support for your TF2 inventories, letting you use all your items in Lambda Fortress. This DOESN'T mean you can use whatever weapon, item and taunt you want. You can only use what you own in TF2 already.<br>
	This does mean that if you don't own a certain weapon, you can't use it. This isn't something we're going to try and circumvent, we don't want any issues from Valve. Thankfully it's not like any weapons are really hard to get, but this may affect Free-to-Plays the most with their limited inventory space.</p>
	
	<h2><ins>What's in the pipeline</ins></h2>
	<p>This is just a small miscellaneous list of things we're working on beyond fixing maps, you'll hopefully see us talk about them once they're implemented. <p>
	<p>- Unique animations for various actions (button pressing, holding props, driving,)<br>
	- Proper decapitations for NPCS including unique head models.<br>
	- More sap-able NPCS for the Sapper.<br>
	- Overhauled menus<br>
	- Vehicle Passenger support</p>

<p>We'll talk about some of these in future blog posts.</p>
<h3>Hopefully you enjoyed this minor update. We hope to see you soon! Thanks for all your support!</h3>
<p> Also, if you somehow haven't already done so, please follow and wishlist us on Steam!</p>
