	<h2><ins>The State of TEP</ins></h2>
	<p>"As one door closes, another opens..."</p>
	<p>In our last blog post, we made it a big point that if we were unable to recruit programmers to the team we would pivot away from developing The Espionage Project as a game. 
	This was unfortunately the outcome that came to be. While we were dissapointed at this outcome, we are very excited to move onto this new path of development.</p>

	<p>To better utilize the talent we already have within the team, we've decided to turn The Espionage Project into an animated short, which will be produced in Blender by our animators. 
	In the process of this change of direction, leadership has been handed off from Not Dave or Daniel to Menoly & Aoki. 
	The script for the short has been completed and is heavily focused on delivering something comedic for you guys. 
	We still plan to release our character models early, but with us making these models for a Blender Animation now, we might hold off on 
	releasing Source Versions until we find the time to port and give them all the bells and whistles they'd need.</p>

	<h2><ins>Casting Calls</ins></h2>
	<p>Since our script is complete, we're ready to bring on voice actors, storyboard artists, and additional 3D animators. 
	If you're interested in applying to our project for one of those positions, check out the role descriptions in our Casting Call Club page and Google Form. 
	You can find the links to those below. You can also send a message @menolydraws on Discord. The deadline for voice actors is January 19th 2026.</p>

	<p>Last time, we showed off our character models for the Guard and Office Worker. 
	They're still not done, but this is because we were not fully satisfied with the results from last time. We've gone and redone their models from scratch, 
	they're now of a higher quality that we're sasified with. Take a look!</p>

	<p>While this blog post may not have been the one you guys have been expecting, we've been exicted to share the news with you regardless, hopefully you enjoyed it. 
	Internally we've been happy with the script we settled on, and the newfound speed of our progress. That'll be all for now, we'll share news on our progress in the future. 
	See you soon!</p>
