	<p>Welcome to the first update on the developments of the The Espionage Project, let's get right into things.</p>
	<h2><ins>The Begging Part</ins></h2>
	<p>"All assets and no code makes Dave a dull boy."</p>
	<p>For a long time now in our Discord server, we've been pretty open about the fact that TEP does not get many updates to its codebase, due to us lacking any active programmers on the team. We've essentially been in the same situation the mod <i>Sine Fortress</i> was in before its recent resurgence. It's become pretty clear to us that it's pretty unsustainable to keep going like this, so we want to make this known: </p>

	<p><b><ins>If we continue to be unable to recruit anymore volunteer programmers to the team, we will more than likely pivot away from developing The Espionage Project as a game.</ins></b></p>

	<p>We pretty much have all we need in terms of developers except for programmers. Another problem as well is that we'd ideally need those with a good amount of experience on Source to ensure the mod is built on a solid code foundation for devs to work off of. If we were to pivot, we would likely transition to being a sort of asset project where we create a pack of assets for the community to use in TF2. Think <i>Frontline</i> or <i>Tropic Crisis</i>. While that's not the outcome we'd prefer, we'd still be happy if we have to go down this route.</p>

	<p>So, if you are a skilled programmer, familiar with Source and willing to help, contact @notdaveordaniel on Discord, or if you know someone who might be interested, tell them about this.</p>


	<h2><ins>Character Models</ins><h2>
	<h3>The Agent V2</h3>
	<p>After we released the Agent model, we received a lot of helpful feedback on the design. We've redone the model to fix a lot of the issues that came from the first. Face posing was originally meant to be added to the first model in an update, but we focused on giving it to the new model instead. </p>

	<h3>WIPs</h3>
	<p>We are currently chipping away at the Guard and Office Worker models. We've been working on these guys since they haven't had any publicly released models yet. Take a look at our WIP work on them. </p>

	<img src="./res/blogImages/the_espionage_project/Worker.png">
	
	<p>We're also working on an alternative Agent model design. We call him "Player 2," another agent fighting alongside the original Agent to add variety to matches.</p>

	<h2><ins>The Beekeeper</ins></h2>
	<p>He's finally real! For those who aren't aware, the Beekeeper was a class originally cut from TF2Classic's espionage in 2018. He was a character originally born in the town of Flasktropolis and his job in the game was to beekeep.</p>

	<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">[Source:                ]</p>

	<p>All jokes aside, Not Dave or Daniel made a concept for a potential Beekeeper design if he were to appear in TEP. TF2C Modeler <i>Samthebitch</i> has gone and made their own model based on said design. They are not affiliated with us but we still wanted to give them a shoutout for creating this awesome model.</p>

	<p>And that's it for our first status update! Again, we're looking for experienced programmers, and if we cannot achieve this, we will pivot the project elsewhere. We're hoping it doesn't come to that, but if it does, we'll still have a lot of fun along the way. See you guys soon! </p>
