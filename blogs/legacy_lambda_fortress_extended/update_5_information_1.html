	<h2><strong>Update 5</strong></h2>
	<p>It’s been a long time since our last blog post, and any information on exciting news! As you may have guessed, the next update has to be as big, or even bigger as the last one. Today, we’ve wanted to make one of the first of a few blog posts regarding big changes in Update 5!</p>
	<h2><strong>Half-Life: Source</strong></h2>
	<p>Our mappers have been working very hard, combining every chapter into one map for a seamless experience of no loading screens. Currently, testing has proven that this method has gone well, and will be used in the final public release of Update 5. So far, we have 1/6 of the game done. This may seem small, but we’ve had private life issues to fix during this time.</p>
	<h2><strong>Portal Support</strong></h2>
	<p>It may have not been too much of a secret, but we wanted to reveal that not only the Portal Gun is supported in Lambda Fortress: Extended Update 5, but the entire Portal game too! We’ve been working hard on squashing all the bugs&nbsp;regarding porting yet another entire game into Lambda Fortress: Extended, and it’s finally in a state where we can show it to you guys!</p>
	<h2><strong>Achievements</strong></h2>
	<p>This may come as a surprise, but we’ve been working real hard on implementing custom achievements for achievement hunters! You may suggest achievements for Lambda Fortress: Extended on the LF:E Discord.</p>
	<h2><strong>Blog post #2 (and #3?)</strong></h2>
	<p>Soon, there will be more blog posts going into detail about more features, such as map add, a certain cosmetic, and a few more things. They will be revealed over the month, be sure to check our discord for more information!</p>
	<h2><strong>Developers Wanted!</strong></h2>
	<p>Currently, we need mappers and artists to help us with various things, such as merging maps and fixing maps. You should know how to use the Synergy MapAdd system, or know how to merge four levels together. We are also looking for artists to help us with things such as achievements, bucket icons, modeling, and logos. You may sign up here!</p>
