	<h2><strong>Update 5 Information #2</strong></h2>
	<p>We’re back with another blog post, this time featuring information about pyrovision, NPC Support, and more!</p>
	<h2><strong>NPC Support</strong></h2>
	<p>NPCs now have support for taking and capturing the intelligence, and capping points! We’re currently working on a method for their AI to seek out these objectives, but it is presumed that mappers can use this with infinitely re-spawning NPCs in maps.</p>
	<h2><strong>Pyrovision</strong></h2>
	<p>You wanted Team Fortress 2’s Art style in Half-Life 2? You’ve got it! With Update 5, our texture artists have been working hard to introduce the most requested and yet biggest change! Unfortunately, this does not use a Cosmetic. This instead uses a convar, and is fully client-side so you will never be forced to use it!</p>
	<h2><strong>NPC Disguising</strong></h2>
	<p>NPC Disguising is now a reality, disguise as a combine and use their voice lines to not be suspicious in versus&nbsp; mode, or perhaps sneak through Ravenholm without bumping into a zombie. The Spy is no longer useless, and has disguises for Combine, Zombies, and Antlions. Combine Disguises come with voice lines for to help with the future Versus Mode.</p>
	<h2><strong>Developers Wanted!</strong></h2>
	<p>Currently, we need mappers and artists to help us with various things, such as merging maps and fixing maps. You should know how to use the Synergy MapAdd system, or know how to merge four levels together. We are also looking for artists to help us with things such as achievements, bucket icons, modeling, and logos. You may sign up here!</p>
