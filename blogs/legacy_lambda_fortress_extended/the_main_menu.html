<p>Today, we showcase our brand new Main Menu, with a sleek look and a live-tf2 styled bar at the top, it introduces many new features and utilities not seen before, such as showcasing the lfe.tf blog right on the menu. We also wanted to show you our new logo, you are welcome to leave opinions on it in our public discord, but please note that itâ€™s not final!</p>
