	<p>Today we are showcasing The Wrangler, it is a unique item used for The Engineerâ€™s secondary slot. It allows you to remotely aim and fire your currently deployed Sentry Gun, and will deploy a Shield to reduce damage when used. It can be used in various situations combined with The Gunslinger to create a powerful Mini-Sentry. When your currently deployed Sentry Gun is Level 3, and you jump while firing rockets at your feet, you can perform a Rocket Jump similar to The Soldier. When you switch away from the wrangler, your currently deployed Sentry Gun will be disabled for up to 3 seconds.</p>
