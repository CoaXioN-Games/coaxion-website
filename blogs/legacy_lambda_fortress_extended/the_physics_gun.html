<p>Today, we showcase the Physics gun, a unique recreation of the original Half-Life 2 Beta Physics gun mixed with Garry’s Mod’s Physics gun. You can use this in a server with “sv_cheats” enabled using the “give_weapon” command. This was put in after multiple requests of a Physics gun in the Beta Discord. It features a unique glow on objects being held, alongside with it not replacing the Gravity Gun.</p>
